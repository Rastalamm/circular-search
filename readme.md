###Good Morning - June 1, 2015

Your challenge this morning is to create a function that implements an algorithm using the concepts we covered last week.

###Challenge
1. Write an algorithm that takes in 2 strings(source, find).
2. Return true if the word passed in as the find parameter is in the source if it were circular. Meaning there is no end to source word. A match would be true if the word to find is partially at the end of the word and at the beginning in sequence.

Ex.

Source: Hotdog

Target: dog

Return: true

Source: Assignments

Target: sass

Return: true

Source: Assignments

Target: sassy

Return: false
